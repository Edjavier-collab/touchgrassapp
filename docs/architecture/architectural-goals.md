# Architectural Goals

• **Real-time resilience** — sub-second timer updates, zero data loss on refresh
• **Privacy by design** — HIPAA-aligned encryption, audit trail, minimal PII
• **Offline-first UX** — WOOP & timer usable without network via service-worker caching
• **Rapid iteration** — serverless stack + CI/CD for weekly releases with low DevOps overhead
