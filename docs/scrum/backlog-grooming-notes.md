# TouchGrass App - Backlog Grooming Notes

## Scrum Master Observations

### Technical Debt & Risks
1. **State Management Complexity** - Timer persistence across page refreshes needs careful implementation
2. **Notification Permissions** - Need fallback strategy if user denies push notifications
3. **Data Migration** - Future account creation needs backward compatibility with anonymous data
4. **Performance** - Animations (confetti, emoji rain) need optimization for low-end devices

### Dependencies to Track
- **Supabase Setup** - Required before Sprint 1 start
- **Push Notification Service** - Needed by Sprint 3
- **Translation Resources** - Spanish translations needed by Sprint 4
- **Security Audit** - Schedule before Sprint 3 completion

### Recommended Adjustments

#### Sprint Velocity
- Sprint 1: Conservative (24 points) - Team forming, tech stack setup
- Sprint 2: Target (28 points) - Should hit stride
- Sprint 3: Aggressive (40 points) - Consider splitting
- Sprint 4: Light (21 points) - Buffer for tech debt

#### Story Refinements Needed
1. **US-7 (Progress Visualization)** - 13 points seems high, consider splitting:
   - Basic line graph (5 points)
   - Advanced charts & tooltips (8 points)

2. **US-17 (Data Encryption)** - Needs security specialist input
   - May need spike for encryption strategy
   - Consider third-party audit requirement

#### Cross-Functional Considerations

**Design Team**
- Mockups needed for: Timer UI, WOOP form, Charts, Celebration animations
- Accessibility review for reduce-motion states
- Spanish UI review with native speaker

**QA Team**
- Test data generation for charts (need 30+ days of data)
- Cross-browser testing for localStorage persistence
- Mobile device testing matrix
- Performance benchmarks for animations

**DevOps**
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Staging environment matching production
- Monitoring for 24-hour timer edge cases
- Backup strategy for user data

### Estimation Confidence Levels
- **High Confidence**: Device registration, WOOP forms, basic timer
- **Medium Confidence**: Charts, notifications, animations
- **Low Confidence**: Encryption implementation, audit logging

### MVP Critical Path
Must-have for launch:
1. Device registration (US-1)
2. WOOP creation (US-3)
3. Timer functionality (US-5, US-6)
4. Basic data persistence

Nice-to-have for MVP:
- Progress visualization
- Celebrations
- Sound effects

### Backlog Prioritization Rationale

**High Priority**
- Core timer functionality (user value)
- Data persistence (technical requirement)
- Accessibility (legal/ethical requirement)
- Security basics (risk mitigation)

**Medium Priority**
- Analytics features (user retention)
- Notifications (engagement)
- Preferences (user satisfaction)
- Data export (privacy compliance)

**Low Priority**
- Animations (delight features)
- Sound effects (enhancement)
- Spanish localization (market expansion)
- Easter eggs (brand personality)

### Action Items for Team
1. [ ] Schedule design sprint for UI mockups
2. [ ] Technical spike on notification services
3. [ ] Security consultation for encryption approach
4. [ ] Performance baseline for animation testing
5. [ ] Create test data generator for QA
6. [ ] Define monitoring alerts for timer edge cases

### Retrospective Topics to Track
- Timer persistence implementation learnings
- Anonymous user data management patterns
- Animation performance optimizations
- Notification delivery rates
- User engagement with WOOP feature
