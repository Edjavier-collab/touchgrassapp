# Overview

Touch-Gras is a web-based application that empowers individuals with substance-use disorder (SUD) to ride out intense cravings. It pairs the evidence-based **WOOP** technique (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) with a real-time 24-hour streak timer, celebratory feedback, and progress analyticsâ€”all delivered anonymously, securely, and playfully.
